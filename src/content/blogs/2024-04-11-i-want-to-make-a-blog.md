# I Want to Make a Blog

So I did.

Unsure of which tech stack to use for this project, but I do know _how_ I want to interact with the blog. Let's figure it out.

## The Requirements

I do my best work in my text editor of choice, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I've worked here for years; all the shortcuts have become ~~second~~ nature. I also happen to do my best writing/note-taking using Markdown. This gives us our first (and probably only) requirement.

1. **Writing should take place in a markdown file inside of a text editor, ideally as a file stored in the project.**

Next, we need a place to put it... I don't care _too_ much about where this blog livesâ€”so I looked in my Google Domains ([now SquareSpace](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/17131164996365-About-the-Google-Domains-migration-to-Squarespace)) graveyard.

[adamsisk.info](https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion) already hosts a (pretty-much) bare-bones Vite/TypeScript/React app, and has for a few years with little to no attention. Lucky for us: CI/CD is already in place, with deployments to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/adam-sisks-projects) as easy as `git push`! Tailwind is, of course, already installed; _this is the perfect place for an over-engineered blog_. Which brings me to requirement #2:

2. **In every possible way, this should be as over-engineered and over-optimized as possible.**

I'm currently working towards earning a promotion to Senior Engineer. The main motive behind a blog is to hold myself accountable to that growth. Typically, the tech requirements would inform which technologies are used and where the app is hosted. In this case, I care more about ease of setup than I do about the tech stack. I just want to get started, but I want to do it myself (as quickly as possible). My plan is to blog about the continued building of this blog, as a learning exercise. I'm fully aware that I'm basically writing this to and for myself. Hello, me... For now, the goal is to make a blog. So I did.

After about 3 hours of late-night [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)-powered coding, it's live! ðŸ•º I'd like to introduce to you my first ever blog: [Hello, world](/blog/2024-04-10-hello-world).
