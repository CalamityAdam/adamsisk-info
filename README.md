# adamsisk.info

This is the source code for my personal website, [adamsisk.info](https://adamsisk.info).

Build with React (but it doesn't need to be) and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

```sh
yarn && yarn dev
```

# things to know

- when writing markdown you can use environment variables by wrapping them in double curly brackets
  - example markdown:
    ```md
    This website is hosted at {{DOMAIN_URL}}!
    ```
  - .env:
    ```
    VITE_DOMAIN_URL=https://adamsisk.info
    ```
  - output:
    ```
    This website is hosted at https://adamsisk.info!
    ```
  - _note:_ if the value inside of the double curlies is not found in .env then the raw markdown will remain untouched.

# code ideas

- a mini code editor - using the same instance of react and deps that's installed on the blog, with a live update display next to it.
- dynamic meta tags in the index.html based on the requested blog path?
- automator quick action for "improve writing"? gpt4-api?

# blog ideas

- breaking down the App component to be templatized and minified
- apply SRP to Posts.tsx (currently 2 reasons to change: UI, and blog posts)
- âœ¨ make npm package for centering app with max width (insta cool SPA) use the max-width
  ```css
  .with-max-width {
    max-width: calc(100vw-32px);
    sm:max-width: calc(100vw-48px);
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  ```
- photo web-site as a service - sign in with google photos and select albums or people
  - auto sorting? auto filtering?
