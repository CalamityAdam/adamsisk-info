# dev.adamsisk.info

This is the source code for my personal website, [dev.adamsisk.info](https://dev.adamsisk.info).

Build with React (but it doesn't need to be) and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

```sh
yarn && yarn dev
```

# TODO

- [x] Add a blog
- [x] update npmrc to not use artifactory (oops!)
- [x] add syntax highlighting to code blocks
- [x] figure out why i get a 404 on the first load of the blog page
- [ ] figure out why backticks are rendering the ticks in addition to the styling
- [ ] finish the theme toggle
