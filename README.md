# dev.adamsisk.info

This is the source code for the dev branch of my personal website, [dev.adamsisk.info](https://dev.adamsisk.info).

This branch is unique in that it contains only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The master branch contains the same content, but is built with React.

## Development

```sh
yarn && yarn dev
```
